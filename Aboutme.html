			  <p>Greetings! My name is Oguz Sarac. I am from Turkey and I am 18 years old. This is my first year at Griffith College and also Dublin, Ireland. I am interested in computer science, video games, sport, and photography. Computers first appeared in my life when I was eight. First game I had was 'Counter-Strike 1.6' and from my perspective, that was the best game in my whole life. Now, I have a better and faster computer but I am still playing 'Counter-Strike 1.6'. When I came to the College first time, I was not able to programming or creating a website. Now, I have my own website and I am proud of myself.</p>
			  <p>My favorite DJ is a Deadmau5. I think he is the best DJ in the World. In each new album of Deadmau5, I am getting excited more than the old one because every album he performs different beats and drops. I went to the Deadmau5 concert once, the concert was in Istanbul and it was more crowded than I expected.</p>
			  <p>I am interesting in Bodybuilding. I am doing that sport since 2016. Also, I am good at Chess I won gold medal two times when I was in high-school.I have always dreamt about of studying abroad, learning the course in different language. I started researching where I could go to fulfill my target. After that, I came across Griffith College. Amazing College in a lovely city. I believe that Griffith College is the option for me to have a solid education and a great friendship and time while studying.</p>
